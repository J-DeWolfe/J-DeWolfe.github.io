## Projects

### Contact List (XML/Java)
An Android application that stores contact information in an SQLite database.

Utilizing the Android Room Persistance Library, this application includes a RoomDatabse, repository, DAO, and entities. It also includes a Fragment plus ViewModel design, a RecyclerView.Adapter plus CardView layout, and a number of AsyncTasks. The user interface features a Floating Action Button, as well as an overflow menu. Custom Toasts are used to communicate with the user. The application can be installed on a physical Android device via Android Studio.

```java
//Sample Code
private static class InsertAsyncTask extends AsyncTask< Contact, Void, Void> {
    private  ContactDao asyncTaskDao;
    InsertAsyncTask(ContactDao dao) { asyncTaskDao = dao; }

    @Override
    protected Void doInBackground(final Contact... params) {
        asyncTaskDao.insertContact(params[0]);
        return null;
    }
}
```

## Something other than Projects

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/J-DeWolfe/J-DeWolfe.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
