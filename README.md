# Portfolio
A simple collection of my own personal projects. 

Written entirely within the GitHub editor, the code for this project relies on [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). If you are having trouble with GitHub Pages, check out their [documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) for help.
